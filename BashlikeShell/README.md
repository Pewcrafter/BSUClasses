NAME

smash - a SHell

SYNOPSIS

smash

DESCRIPTION

Smash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input. Smash also incorporates useful 	  features from other external sources so that you may run it like a real shell (e.g. bash).

After running smash, the following commands are available internally:

history - returns the most recent 10 commands from standard input and returns their exit statuses

exit - frees all remaining memory and exits smash

cd [filepath] - changes the working directory to filepath
